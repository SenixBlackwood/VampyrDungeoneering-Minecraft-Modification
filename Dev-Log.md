# Dev-Log
Development-logs are a common feature in game development that provide insight into the creation process of a game or modification.  
They typically take the form of written or video updates that detail the progress made by the development team, as well as any new features, assets, or gameplay mechanics that have been added or changed.  
Development-logs can be used as a way to communicate with the community and build hype and anticipation for a game or mod, as well as to solicit feedback and suggestions from players.  
They can also be a valuable tool for developers to reflect on their progress and make adjustments to their development process as needed.  
Overall, development-logs are a useful and informative resource for both developers and players alike, providing a window into the exciting world of game development.
